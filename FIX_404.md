# 🔧 Fix 404 Error - GitHub Pages Setup

## ⚠️ The Problem

You're seeing a 404 error because GitHub Actions needs permission to deploy to GitHub Pages.

## ✅ Solution: Enable Workflow Permissions

Follow these steps **exactly**:

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings

1. Visit: https://github.com/ashurauza/Seminar_Auditorium_Allocation_App/settings
2. Look in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Configure Actions Permissions

1. In the left sidebar, click **"Actions"** → **"General"**
2. Scroll down to **"Workflow permissions"** section
3. Select: **"Read and write permissions"** ✅
4. Check the box: **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** ✅
5. Click **"Save"** button at the bottom

### Step 3: Verify Pages Settings

1. In the left sidebar, click **"Pages"**
2. Under **"Build and deployment"**:
   - **Source:** Should be "GitHub Actions" ✅
3. That's it!

### Step 4: Re-run the Workflow

After enabling permissions, the workflow needs to run again:

**Option A: Push a small change**
```bash
# Make any small change and push
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment"
git push origin main
```

**Option B: Manually re-run from GitHub**
1. Go to: https://github.com/ashurauza/Seminar_Auditorium_Allocation_App/actions
2. Click on the latest "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Re-run all jobs" button

### Step 5: Wait for Deployment

1. Go to Actions tab: https://github.com/ashurauza/Seminar_Auditorium_Allocation_App/actions
2. Watch for green checkmark ✅ (2-3 minutes)
3. Visit: https://ashurauza.github.io/Seminar_Auditorium_Allocation_App/

## 📸 What to Look For

### In Actions → General → Workflow permissions:
```
● Read and write permissions  ← Select this!
○ Read repository contents and packages permissions

☑ Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests
```

## 🎯 Quick Fix Command

Run this to trigger a new deployment after fixing permissions:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment with correct permissions"
git push origin main
```

## ✅ How to Verify It's Fixed

1. Actions tab shows green checkmark ✅
2. Pages settings shows: "Your site is live at https://ashurauza.github.io/Seminar_Auditorium_Allocation_App/"
3. Visiting the URL loads your app (no 404!)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still getting 404?
- Wait 5 minutes after deployment completes
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
- Try incognito/private browsing mode

### Workflow failing?
- Check Actions tab for error messages
- Ensure "Read and write permissions" is enabled
- Verify Pages source is "GitHub Actions"

### Need to check logs?
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on the failed workflow
3. Click on "deploy" job
4. Read error messages
